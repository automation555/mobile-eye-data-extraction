Mobile-Eye-Data-Extraction is a simple script to make sense of the data files generated from ASL's Mobile Eye Eye Tracker / EyeVision software.

*** Installing ***
1. Make sure Ruby is installed. Enter 'ruby -v' (without quotes) at the terminal command line. You should see a response that looks something like 'ruby 1.8.6'
2. Navigate to the directory where mobile-eye-data-extraction is stored.
3. Enter 'ruby extract.rb sample_data.csv' to make sure the script is working properly. You should see many lines of output from the program and will find two new files in the directory (sample_data_timecodes.txt and sample_data_data.txt)

*** Usage ***
ruby extract.rb <datafile.csv> <optional offset>
The <datafile.csv> should be the filename of raw data generated by ASL EyeVision software

The script will generate two new .csv files:

*** _timecodes.txt ***
This file contains one row per each fixation. A timestamp is included in each row. This file can be imported into transcription software for the purpose of coding the fixations.

*** _data.txt ***
This file contains also one row per fixation. Each row includes a unique id, a timestamp, and a duration (represented by frames).

*** TODO ***
- Command line config options to cusomize definition of a fixation
- Scene detection
