Mobile-Eye-Data-Extraction is a simple script to make sense of the data files generated from ASL's Mobile Eye Eye Tracker / EyeVision software.

*** Usage ***
ruby extract.rb <datafile.csv> <optionalVideo.csv>

The script will generate two new .csv files:

*** timecodes.csv ***
This simply creates one row per each fixation. A timestamp is included in each row. This file can be imported into transcription software to help with coding.

*** data.csv ***
This creates one row per fixation. Each row includes a unique id, a timestamp, and a duration (represented by frames).

*** TODO ***
- Command line config options to cusomize definition of a fixation
- Scene detection
